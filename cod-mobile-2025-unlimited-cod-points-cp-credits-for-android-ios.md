### What Are COD Points (CP) & Credits in COD Mobile?

Before we jump into the free offer, let's take a moment to understand what COD Points (CP) and Credits actually are in the context of COD Mobile:

- **COD Points (CP):** These are the premium currency used in the game. CP can be used to purchase various items in the store, such as new character skins, weapon blueprints, and even the Battle Pass. CP is typically bought with real money, and accumulating a significant amount can be time-consuming if you don‚Äôt want to spend your money.

- **Credits:** Unlike CP, Credits are the free currency you earn simply by playing the game. Credits can also be used to unlock certain in-game content, but they are more limited in comparison to CP. While you can earn Credits through regular gameplay, CP remains the go-to currency for players who want immediate access to premium items.

Both of these currencies play a crucial role in enhancing your experience in COD Mobile, which is why many players look for ways to get more of them.
